      At first, I liked playing games simply. However, I gradually became 
      interested in development, so I majored in computer programming 
      at college. While attending school, I felt more attracted to programming
       by doing various assignments and group projects. Also, my personality is 
       to scrutinize even the smallest details, and this tendency has helped me
        to find errors in code quickly and write code efficiently. Lastly, 
        I am planning to upload the concepts I learned while studying to
         become a full-stack developer and the projects I participated in.
